# Pre-Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist before deploying n8n to Kubernetes for the first time.

## ‚òê AWS Setup

### ECR Repository
- [ ] Create ECR repository in ap-east-1 region
  ```bash
  aws ecr create-repository \
    --repository-name n8n-platform \
    --region ap-east-1 \
    --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true
  ```
- [ ] Verify repository created: `aws ecr describe-repositories --region ap-east-1`

### IAM Permissions
- [ ] Verify deployment IAM role exists
- [ ] Check role has ECR push permissions
- [ ] Check role has EKS access permissions
- [ ] Test role assumption works
  ```bash
  aws sts assume-role --role-arn <DEPLOY_AWS_ROLE_ARN> --role-session-name test
  ```

### EKS Cluster Access
- [ ] Staging cluster accessible: `aws eks describe-cluster --name f4fpay-staging-20250109 --region us-east-1`
- [ ] Production cluster accessible: `aws eks describe-cluster --name f4fpay-production-20230709 --region us-east-1`
- [ ] kubectl configured: `aws eks update-kubeconfig --name f4fpay-staging-20250109 --region us-east-1`
- [ ] Can list pods: `kubectl get pods -n default`

## ‚òê GitHub Configuration

### Repository Setup
- [ ] Repository exists and accessible
- [ ] Main branch protected (if desired)
- [ ] GitHub Actions enabled

### Secrets Configuration
- [ ] Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
- [ ] Add AWS secrets:
  - [ ] `DEPLOY_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - [ ] `DEPLOY_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  - [ ] `DEPLOY_AWS_ROLE_ARN`

- [ ] Generate and add staging secrets:
  ```bash
  # PostgreSQL password
  openssl rand -base64 24

  # n8n encryption key
  openssl rand -hex 32

  # Basic auth password
  openssl rand -base64 24
  ```
  - [ ] `STAGING_POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
  - [ ] `STAGING_N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
  - [ ] `STAGING_N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER` (e.g., "admin")
  - [ ] `STAGING_N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`

- [ ] Verify all secrets added: Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions (should show 8 secrets)

## ‚òê DNS Configuration

### Staging Domain
- [ ] DNS record exists for `staging-n8n.first4figures.com`
- [ ] Record points to staging cluster load balancer OR
- [ ] Plan to update DNS after ingress IP is available
- [ ] Test DNS resolution: `nslookup staging-n8n.first4figures.com`

### Production Domain (For later)
- [ ] DNS record planned for `n8n.first4figures.com`
- [ ] Domain ownership verified

## ‚òê Kubernetes Cluster Preparation

### cert-manager (for TLS certificates)
- [ ] cert-manager installed in cluster
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -n cert-manager
  ```
- [ ] If not installed, install it:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.13.0/cert-manager.yaml
  ```
- [ ] Verify cert-manager running:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -n cert-manager
  ```

### Nginx Ingress Controller
- [ ] Nginx ingress controller installed
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
  ```
- [ ] Ingress controller has external IP
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx
  ```

### Storage Class
- [ ] Check `gp2` storage class exists
  ```bash
  kubectl get storageclass gp2
  ```
- [ ] Verify it can provision volumes

### Datadog (Optional but recommended)
- [ ] Datadog agent running in cluster
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -n datadog
  ```
- [ ] Or plan to install Datadog later

## ‚òê Local Testing

### Helm Chart Validation
- [ ] Helm installed locally (3.11.1+)
  ```bash
  helm version
  ```
- [ ] Validate staging chart:
  ```bash
  helm lint infra/deployment/staging/k8s/
  ```
- [ ] Validate production chart:
  ```bash
  helm lint infra/deployment/production/k8s/
  ```
- [ ] Template rendering works:
  ```bash
  helm template test infra/deployment/staging/k8s/ \
    --set postgres.password=test \
    --set n8n.encryptionKey=test \
    --set n8n.basicAuth.user=test \
    --set n8n.basicAuth.password=test
  ```

### Dockerfile Build Test
- [ ] Docker installed locally
- [ ] Dockerfile builds successfully:
  ```bash
  docker build -f Dockerfile.k8s -t n8n-platform:test .
  ```
